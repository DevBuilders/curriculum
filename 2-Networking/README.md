# Hands on class work

The goal of the hands on class work is to pair up and build a node script to spit out a list of nearby devices on the network around you.

## User stories

* As a developer, I want to write a script that scans the network around me to find other devices on the network.
  * Use the arp table to find devices
* As a developer, I want to output a markdown file that lists out the network devices I found around me.
