This week, as promised, we'll look at Graph Theory.

Here are the readings:

* [A Gentle Introduction To Graph Theory](https://medium.com/basecs/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-theory-77969829ead8)
* [KÃ¶nigsberg: Seven Small Bridges, One Giant Graph Problem](https://medium.com/basecs/k%C3%B6nigsberg-seven-small-bridges-one-giant-graph-problem-2275d1670a12)

Coding assignment: TBD. We may just wait a week. For those that didn't have a chance to do the tree coding exercise, please do :)
