This week, as promised, we'll look at Graph Theory.

Here are the readings:

* [A Gentle Introduction To Graph Theory](https://medium.com/basecs/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-theory-77969829ead8)
* [KÃ¶nigsberg: Seven Small Bridges, One Giant Graph Problem](https://medium.com/basecs/k%C3%B6nigsberg-seven-small-bridges-one-giant-graph-problem-2275d1670a12)
* [From Theory To Practice: Representing Graphs](https://medium.com/basecs/from-theory-to-practice-representing-graphs-cfd782c5be38)
* [Going Broad In A Graph: BFS Traversal](https://medium.com/basecs/going-broad-in-a-graph-bfs-traversal-959bd1a09255)
* [Deep Dive Through A Graph: DFS Traversal](https://medium.com/basecs/deep-dive-through-a-graph-dfs-traversal-8177df5d0f13 )

Coding assignment:

Given the following undirected graph:

V = { "Seattle", "Denver", "Chicago", "San Diego", "Detroit", "Minneapolis",
"Boston", "Atlanta"}
E = {
  {"Chicago", "Denver"},
  {"Seattle", "Denver"},
  {"Chicago", "Denver"},
  {"Chicago", "Detroit"},
  {"Chicago", "Atlanta"},
  {"Detroit", "Minneapolis"},
  {"Detroit", "Boston"},
  {"Boston", "Atlanta"},
}

* Given one city, calculate the path to another.
* Implement BFS and DFS. Are the results different?
* Use whatever language makes you happiest :)
* Write tests, preferably TDD
