So for this week, let's tackle recursion. At it's most basic
form, recursion describes a function which invokes itself. Many
problems that can solve with iteration (loops) you can also
solve with recursion.

Here are a couple of the best articles I could find on the
subject:

https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/recursive-algorithms/a/the-factorial-function
https://medium.com/@daniel.oliver.king/getting-started-with-recursion-f89f57c5b60e

Please read these and we will discuss them. If you have other articles
or books that cover the subject of recursion, feel free to share them as well.

For coding exercises:

[Beer Song](http://exercism.io/exercises/kotlin/beer-song/readme)

With this additional contraint: No Loops allowed! Only recursion :)
