#### Assignment:

Implement a set data structure in any language of your choosing.

It should have the following methods:
  - `add` -> adds a value to the set
  - `remove` -> removes a value from the set
  - `has` -> checks if a value exists in the set

You should also implement the following functions. Whether or not they are methods on your set class is up to you:
  - `union` -> returns the union of 2 sets
  - `intersection` -> returns the intersection of 2 sets
  - `setDifference` -> returns the set difference of 2 sets
  - `relativeComplement` -> returns the relative complement of 2 sets
  - `symmetricDifference` -> returns the symmetric difference of 2 sets
